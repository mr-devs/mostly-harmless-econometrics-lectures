# mostly-harmless-econometrics-lectures
Slides from the American Economic Associations (AEA) lectures by Alberto Abadie, Joshua Angrist, and Christopher Walters which generally summarize causal inference methods described in the book Mostly Harmless Econometrics (Angrist &amp; Pischke, 2008).

## Videos
These slides were presented at the above described event, which was recorded and is publicly on the AEA's website [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2020-webcasts). Hopefully, these will not be taken down but in the case that they are, I wanted to snag the slides for posterity.

## Book
Joshua Angrist wrote a famous econometrics book called "[Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/FLS6415/Class_3/Angrist%20&%20Pischke.pdf)", which (I believe) these lectures are loosley based on.

You may also be interested in supporting the author's by purchasing a copy.
